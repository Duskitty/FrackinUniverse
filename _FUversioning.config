  * Battle Totem armor set now costs more Sharpened Claws to compensate for its Crit bonus
  
  * Katana Parry timing adjusted
  
  * Pesticide repurposed. It is now a rather handy fertilizer type for speed and output, but will suck up a lot of water as a consequence

  * More balance changes to trays: Water use increased by +1, and baseYield for both tray types reduced to 2
  
  * Collections code adjusted (ColonelNutty)
  
  * Growing and Hydro tray UI adjusted
  
  * Hydroponics Tray name shortened to fit in space required for new UI
  
  _____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.182^reset;
  
  * Trays output increased, which should make life a little easier. Default output is now 3 for the Growing Tray and 4 for the Hydro Tray, to match the input of 3 seeds with a slight bonus. Fertilizers improve this amount.
  
  * corrected broken unlocks for the extra tiers of Mass Cancellation techs for your Mech. You should now be able to unlock all the way up to 100% mass reduction.
  
  
  _____________________________________________________

  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.179^reset;
  
  * mechs update Mass properly when changing parts on their inventory screen
  
  * extractors have Take All button
  
  
  * Trays not accepting seeds if there wasn't at least the default required amount, even if fertilizer reduced it

  ^orange;Growing Tray Rewrite: ^reset; (ProfoundDarkness, Lucca)
  
    * Growing/Hydroponics trays have been completely reworked from scratch to be more efficient and pull from actual seed data. Overall, their operation will be effectively the same from your end, but you'll definitely see changes in how they behave.
    
    * Trays use plant growth stages to determine water consumption
    
    * Trays use the plant's treasurepools for output
    
    * Perennial plants act as perennial plants do, in that they reset to their reset stage and don't consume extra seeds.
    
    * Trays no longer allow Tree growth
